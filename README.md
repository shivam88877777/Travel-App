# Travel-App
This is the capstone project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program which allows a user to see the weather for their departure date and see a photo from their destination. This application uses the Geonames API to obtain the longitude and latitude of a location, the Weatherbit API to obtain weather data, and the Pixabay API to obtain a photo of the location.
